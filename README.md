# Painting with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The "Painting with AI" project involves using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create, enhance, or inspire artistic works, combining human creativity with machine-generated outputs. This project typically explores how AI can contribute to visual arts by generating images, offering stylistic transformations, or assisting artists in refining their work. 


## Background

Discuss the evolution of AI in creative fields, particularly in visual arts. Highlight key milestones, such as generative models, and how AI tools have opened new possibilities for artists and hobbyists alike.


## How is it used?

Explore practical applications:

AI-assisted painting for creating original artworks.
Style transfer to mimic famous artists’ techniques.
Concept generation for artists to refine manually.
Commercial uses like illustrations and advertising

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Explain the data used (public datasets or curated collections) and the specific AI methods employed:

Neural networks like GANs, VAEs, or transformers.
Pre-trained models (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion).
Tools and libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Challenges

Highlight technical and artistic challenges, such as:

Balancing creativity and coherence.
Data quality and biases.
Computational requirements.

## What next?

Discuss future developments:

Enhancing interactivity for artists.
Integrating with AR/VR.
Exploring ethical and copyright considerations.
